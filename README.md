# What?

A WebExtension that automatically detects cookie consent banners on websites and removes them.

# Why?

This add-on automatically detects GDPR cookie consent banners that have to be included in many websites nowadays. These banners can be annyoing as they cover unnecessary screen space. If you already have other means for handling cookies in websites you visit (e.g. browsing in private mode) or you simply don't care about cookies at all, this is the add-on for you.

# Get it

The add-on is currently available for the Firexfox browser under this link: https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/who-cares-about-cookies/
